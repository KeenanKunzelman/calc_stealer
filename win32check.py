# OHHH fuck if you are reading this you forgott everyting and fell asleep
# I need to extract key drive info from the string first and store it in obj
# well good luck but here were my ideas at 10pm. Make drive object that holds
# string values about a drive. Then feed that to mount_drive method. I have to 
# unpack the object here though and modify the method to accept the object as input.
# it got way worse its 1030 and I fucked a lot of shit up probably
